# The Node.js Master Class

This is the _Node.js_ course from Pirple https://pirple.thinkific.com/courses/the-nodejs-master-class repository to learn and deliver homework assignments.

## How is this repository organized?

Instead of having several repositories for the same curse, I prefer only one with several branches in order to avoid naming pollution.

As a rule of the thumb, there will be *one branch per chapter* (named after the chapter normalized to lowercase and hyphens instead of spaces) and the *master* branch which contains this `README.md` acting as index.

Also *one branch per homework assignment* that could be or could not be created from respective chapter.

* [master](https://github.com/fulldump/pirple-node-master-class)
* [building-a-restful-api](https://github.com/fulldump/pirple-node-master-class/tree/building-a-restful-api)
  * [homework-assignment-1](https://github.com/fulldump/pirple-node-master-class/tree/homework-assignment-1)
